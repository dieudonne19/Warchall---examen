## First step :
---
- First of all, we have to connect to *ssh* server after registration :
  `ssh -p 19198 dieudonne@warchall.net`
- Then, go to levels directory :
  `cd /home/level/`
- And, practice levels.
---
*List of commands* we will use for *level 0-5* : 
- `cd` : *change directory*.
- `ls` : *list files in the current folder*.
- `ls -la` : *list all files in the current folder*.
- `cat` : *output file's content*.
